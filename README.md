# comonad-automata

Port of http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/12/evaluating-cellular-automata-is.html to typescript.

Implemented: Lazy (Functor), LazyList (Functor), Zipper (Functor, Comonad) types.

Looks nicer in haskell, but the result is actually better than expected.




*Note: not to take any seriously. it's just a (cool) evening project*
